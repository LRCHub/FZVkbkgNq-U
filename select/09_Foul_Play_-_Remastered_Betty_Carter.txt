You threw my love
Away
It didn't have to be
Why did you pick on my Foul Play

Okay
Maybe I'll learn
Someday
To give my heart
A break
And make no more mistakes with Foul Play
You looked right in my eyes
And starting telling lies
You had been planning from
The start away to break my heart

Someday
Foul play might come your way
Then maybe you will learn
It's time that you got burn by Foul Play

You looked right in my eyes
And started telling lies
You had been planning from the start away
To break my heart

Someday
Foul play might come your way
Then maybe you will learn
It's time that you got burn by Foul Play
