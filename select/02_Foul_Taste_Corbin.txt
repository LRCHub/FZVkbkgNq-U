(My hearts bleeding bleeding
Barely beating beating
I lost all feeling
On the floor just staring at the ceiling)
cre you sated?
cre you full yet?
cgitated, can we cool it?
Feeling stupid, feeling useless
Why we do this? We tie our nooses
Baby I'm trying
No saving, more lying
You drive me crazy, I'm crying
Time wasted it's flying by
I won't be that guy
I treated you right
I need a new spine, I guess
I Can't stand up right
Wasting your time with me,
Baby, please open your eyes
Bad taste, chased with doesn't feel right
I'm fading, I'm fleeting
My hearts bleeding bleeding
Barely beating beating
I Lost all feeling feeling
On the floor just staring at the ceiling
Going straight through the red light speeding,
Burn my lips, they're peeling
cll the scars they're healing
Don't cum near me, like a pandemic
I'm not a spirit, I'm just a man
cre you sated?
cre you full yet?
cgitated, can we cool it?
Feeling stupid, feeling useless
Why we do this? We tie our nooses
Baby I'm trying
No saving, more lying
You drive me crazy, I'm crying
Time wasted it's flying by
Yeah you eat me up from the inside
But I beat myself up on the outside
Tryna kick me when I'm down, I got no pride left
Why you treat me like a clown, when I don't smile?
Thought I could believe it
But you were deceiving
Could've been my one redeemer
Baby you're just a demon
Lost girl, a blood stealer
Why I never saw you in the mirror?
The fog's gone now I see clearer
My love was drug I was your dealer
My hearts bleeding bleeding
Barely beating beating
I Lost all feeling feeling
On the floor just staring at the ceiling
